# Pok-mon-Evolutionary-Tree
Implemented an Evolutionary Tree Abstract Data Types (ADT) in C using a binary search tree to model Pokémon species relationships. Supports insertion, traversal, ancestry and relative queries, evolution path finding, tree reconstruction from traversal data, and generation of intermediate species using stacks, queues, and recursive algorithms.
